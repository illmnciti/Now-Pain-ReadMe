# Now-Pain-ReadMe
Hi I'm Gene and this is my fullstack project!  
We used PostgreSQL and Flask in order to create a web interface that receptionists can use in order to manipulate and read patient data easily.  
As the code and details of this project contains sensitive information, please email me @ ghp7469@nyu.edu in order to request access to the code.  
Thank you for understanding,  
Gene Park
